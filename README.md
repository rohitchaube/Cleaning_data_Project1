======================

Cleaning Data - Coursera Sept 2014

The Repo includes just one script - run_analysis.R 

As expected the R script run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

The Codebook give further details about the variables used and the flow of the script
